# iucn-redlist-species-analysis

Contains the same analysis done for Central Indian landscape, based on a (likely non exhaustive) list of species colleagues were able to gather up.

[NOTE: the data and results folders have the wrong files in this branch, because of some mistake I made in handling branches. The CIL list and results CSV have NOT been uploaded.]
